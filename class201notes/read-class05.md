## HTML Media - Using Images, Common Images, and Choosing Image Formats

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

    * Visually impaired users could be using a screen reader so the alt attribute would be read out loud to them

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

    * Add some alt text

    * Set the images correct width and height

    * Set a title on the image

3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

    * The figure element in HTML is typically used to encapsulate and provide a semantic meaning to content that is referenced in the main flow of a document, often accompanied by a caption. It's particularly useful for media elements like images, illustrations, diagrams, videos, or code snippets.

4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

    * A gif is like a series of pictures put together like a flip-book. They can be used for simple animations but are not ideal for large file size.

    * An SVG is like a set of instruction for the computer to draw a picture. It can be scaled better without losing quality. They are good for logos or icons and have small file size.
