# Reading Notes Class 02

## Reading Questions

1. What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?

    * Write a failing test first.

    * Write the minimum code to pass the test.

    * Refactor the code to improve design without changing behavior.

2. Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?

    * The if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts is used to control the execution of code when the script is run as the main program versus when it is imported as a module into another script.

    * Use cases for including this conditional:

        Executing certain code only when the script is run directly.

        Defining functions or classes that can be imported and reused without executing specific code.

        Running test suites or demonstrations when the script is run as the main program.

        Separating executable code from reusable module code to enhance modularity and reusability.

3. Describe the concept of recursion in Python.

    * Recursion in Python is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem

4. What is the difference between Python modules and packages? Explain how to create, import, and use them in your Python programs.

    * Module: A module is a single Python file containing variables, functions, and classes. It serves as a reusable unit of code that can be imported into other Python scripts.

    * Package: A package is a collection of modules grouped together in a directory with a special __init__.py file. It allows for hierarchical structuring of modules and helps organize large codebases.
