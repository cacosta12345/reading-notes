# Reading Notes Class 04

## Reading Questions

1. What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?

    * Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects. They are similar to constructor functions in Javascript. eg.
    class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

    myobjectx = MyClass()

    In this case the object myobjectx is an instance of the class MyClass and has the same properties as defined above, like a variable called "variable" and a function called "function"

2. Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?

    * A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case

    * Example: Let's consider the classic example of calculating the factorial of a number using recursion. The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 *4* 3 *2* 1.

    def factorial(n):
        # Base case: the factorial of 1 is 1
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        # Recursive case: n! = n *(n-1)!
        else:
            return n* factorial(n - 1)

    print(factorial(5))  # Outputs 120

    In this example, factorial(n) calls itself with n - 1 until it reaches the base case where n is 1.

3. What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.

    * In testing, a fixture provides a defined, reliable and consistent context for the tests. This could include environment (for example a database configured with known parameters) or content (such as a dataset).

    Fixtures define the steps and data that constitute the arrange phase of a test. In pytest, they are functions you define that serve this purpose. They can also be used to define a testâ€™s act phase; this is a powerful technique for designing more complex tests.

    * Chatgpt answer:
 
    Using pytest fixtures and code coverage together enhances the quality and maintainability of Python projects in several ways:

    Effective Test Creation: pytest fixtures allow for writing efficient, reusable, and modular tests. This facilitates thorough testing of the application, including edge cases.

    Coverage Analysis: After writing tests, tools like coverage.py combined with the pytest-cov plugin are used to assess which parts of the codebase are being tested. This analysis highlights areas lacking tests.

    Improving Test Coverage: Based on the coverage report, additional tests can be written or existing ones refined using pytest fixtures to ensure untested parts of the code are covered.

    Confident Maintenance and Refactoring: Continuous monitoring of code coverage ensures that new features or code refactoring don't inadvertently reduce test coverage. pytest fixtures ease the process of updating tests to align with code changes.

    Automation in CI/CD Pipelines: Integrating pytest for automated testing and coverage tools for coverage reporting in CI/CD pipelines ensures that new code changes are thoroughly tested and maintain high standards of test coverage.

    In essence, the combination of pytest fixtures and code coverage tools creates a robust testing environment, leading to more reliable, maintainable, and high-quality software development.
