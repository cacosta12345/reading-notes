# Reading Notes Class 12

## Reading Questions

1. Explain the purpose and basic functionality of the Pandas library. What are some common operations that can be performed on data using Pandas, and how do they contribute to data analysis and manipulation?

    * Purpose: data cleaning and preperation, data analysis, data representation, data integration.

    * Basic Functionality: Data Structures: The two primary data structures of pandas are DataFrame (2-dimensional) and Series (1-dimensional).

    A DataFrame is like a spreadsheet, containing an ordered collection of columns, each of which can be a different type (numeric, string, boolean, etc.).
    A Series is a single column of a DataFrame.
    Data Importing/Exporting: Pandas can read and write data in various formats like CSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON, and more.

    Indexing and Selection: Provides various methods to access and modify data in the DataFrame.

    * Common Operations: Data Wrangling: This includes operations like filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating data. For instance, you can group data based on a category and calculate summary statistics.

    Handling Missing Data: Pandas provides tools to identify, fill, and drop missing data, which is essential for preparing a dataset for analysis.

    Merging and Joining: Combining data from different sources is a common operation, similar to SQL joins.

2. What are the primary data structures in Pandas, and how do they differ in terms of use cases?

    * Series: a one-dimensional labeled array holding data of any type
    such as integers, strings, Python objects etc.

    DataFrame: a two-dimensional data structure that holds data like a two-dimension array or a table with rows and columns.

3. Describe the process of loading a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. What are some common file formats that can be used, and which Pandas functions are utilized to read these formats?

    * Process: import pandas, read the Dataset, create DataFrame

    * Common file formats: CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL Database, Parquet, HTML

    * Functions to read above formats: pd.read_csv, pd.read_excel, pd.read_json, pd.read_sql, pd.read_parquet, pd.read_html
