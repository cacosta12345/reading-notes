1. What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application?

    * The key components of the Django framework that contribute to building a web application are:

    Models: Define the structure of the database. They are classes that Django uses to create database tables and manage the data.

    Views: Control what data is displayed on a page and how it's displayed. They receive web requests and return web responses.

    Templates: Manage the presentation layer. Templates are HTML files which allow Python-like expressions for dynamic content generation.

    URL Dispatcher: Maps URLs to specific views. It allows you to design URLs however you want and connect them to the views you want to display.

    Admin: An auto-generated, ready-to-use interface for site administrative activities, making CRUD operations straightforward.

    Forms: Simplify the creation of form-related operations. They handle the display and input of form data, along with validation.

    Security Features: Provide built-in protections against common attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, and clickjacking.

    Each component plays a specific role in handling web application requests, processing data, and presenting responses to the user, collectively enabling rapid and scalable web application development.
    
2. Explain the role of Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.

    * Django's MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture splits a web application into three interconnected components, streamlining the web request-response cycle:

    Model: Defines the data structure. This layer interacts with the database to retrieve, store, and manage data.

    View: Handles the business logic. Views receive web requests, process data through models, and decide which template to use for the response.

    Template: Manages the presentation layer. Templates define how the data should be presented to the user in HTML format.

    In a typical web request-response cycle, a request first arrives at Django, which then uses the URL dispatcher to determine which view should handle the request. The view interacts with the appropriate model(s) to retrieve or update data from the database. Then, it passes this data to a template, which renders it to HTML. Finally, the view sends the HTML response back to the client. This architecture promotes separation of concerns, making applications easier to develop and maintain.

3. What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?

    * Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without writing custom CSS. Unlike Bootstrap, which offers pre-designed components (like buttons, navbars, etc.), Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let you build unique designs directly in your HTML. Tailwind emphasizes a more "build from scratch" approach with more flexibility and customization, while Bootstrap focuses on a faster development process with its ready-to-use components, leading to a more uniform look across websites.
