2. What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?

    * NumPy provides:

    Multi-dimensional arrays.
    Mathematical functions.
    Array manipulation.
    Broadcasting.
    Random number generation.
    File input/output.
    Integration with other libraries.
    It's useful for:

    Efficient array operations.
    Simplified code for numerical data.
    Advanced data analysis and modeling.
    Compatibility with other scientific libraries.

3. Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.

    * Basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays:

    NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements are of the same data type.
    They have a fixed size and shape, specified upon creation.
    NumPy arrays support vectorized operations, allowing for efficient element-wise operations without the need for explicit looping.
    NumPy arrays can be multidimensional, enabling representation of matrices and higher-dimensional data.
