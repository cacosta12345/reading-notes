# Reading Notes Class 03

## Reading Questions

1. What is the purpose of the ‘with’ statement when opening a file in Python, and how does it help manage resources while reading and writing files?

    * The with statement in Python is used to ensure proper acquisition and release of resources, particularly when dealing with file I/O operations. When opening a file using with, it automatically handles the cleanup process, ensuring that the file is properly closed once the block of code within the with statement is executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

2. Explain the difference between the ‘read()’ and ‘readline()’ methods for file objects in Python. Provide examples of when to use each method.

    * The read() and readline() methods are both used for reading data from file objects in Python, but they behave differently:

    read(): Reads the entire contents of the file and returns it as a single string. It reads the file until the end of the file (EOF) is reached.

    readline(): Reads a single line from the file and returns it as a string. It reads characters from the file until it encounters a newline character (\n) or reaches the end of the file.

3. Briefly describe the concept of exception handling in Python. How can the ‘try’, ‘except’, and ‘finally’ blocks be used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code? Provide a simple example.

    * Exception handling in Python is a mechanism for gracefully managing errors that occur during the execution of a program. It allows developers to anticipate and respond to exceptional conditions, such as invalid inputs, file I/O errors, or network failures, without causing the program to terminate abruptly.
