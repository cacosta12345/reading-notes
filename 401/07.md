# Reading Notes Class 07

## Reading Questions

1. Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.

    * In programming, the scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects, and so on. A name will only be visible to and accessible by the code in its scope. Several programming languages take advantage of scope for avoiding name collisions and unpredictable behaviors. Most commonly, you’ll distinguish two general scopes:

    Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

    Global Example:
        >>> var = 100
        >>> def func():
        ...     return var  # You can access var from inside func()
        ...
        >>> func()
        100
        >>> var  # Remains unchanged
        100


    Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

    Local Example:
    >>> def square(base):
    ...     result = base ** 2
    ...     print(f'The square of {base} is: {result}')
    ...
    >>> square(10)
    The square of 10 is: 100
        >>> result  # Isn't accessible from outside square()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
            result
        NameError: name 'result' is not defined
        >>> base  # Isn't accessible from outside square()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
            base
        NameError: name 'base' is not defined
        >>> square(20)
        The square of 20 is: 400

2. How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?

    * Local (or function) scope is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression. This Python scope contains the names that you define inside the function. These names will only be visible from the code of the function. It’s created at function call, not at function definition, so you’ll have as many different local scopes as function calls. This is true even if you call the same function multiple times, or recursively. Each call will result in a new local scope being created.

    * Global (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in your code.

3. In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.

    * Big O notation provides a high-level understanding of how an algorithm performs, especially as the size of the input increases. It allows developers and computer scientists to compare the efficiency of different algorithms in a standardized way.

4. Based on the Rolling Dice Example, explain how you would simulate a dice roll using Python. Describe how you would use code to calculate the probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., the probability of rolling a 6) over a large number of trials.

    * Create a function that returns a random number between 1 and 6.

    * Initialize a counter, run the roll dice function x amount of times and add up how many times the desired number was rolled. After all trials, calculate the probability by dividing the count of the specific number by the total number of trials.
