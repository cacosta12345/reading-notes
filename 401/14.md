# Reading Notes Class 14

## Reading Questions

1. What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

    * Matplotlib is excellent for creating simple and complex static plots. It's often used for simple bar charts, line charts,  and scatter plots

    * Seaborn adds statistical functionality and is ideal for exploratory data analysis with an emphasis on statistical plots. It's often used for heat maps, time series, and time plots

    * Bokeh excels in creating interactive visualizations for web applications. It's idel for interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications

2. In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

    * Relational
    Main Function: relplot()
    Purpose: This function is used for visualizing statistical relationships between data. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It's particularly useful for understanding the relationship between two or more variables.

    Example Use Case: Showing the relationship between 'miles per gallon' and 'horsepower' in a dataset of different car models. This can help to understand how the increase in horsepower affects fuel efficiency.

    * Categorical
    catplot(): The most general function, it provides access to several axes-level functions that show the relationship between a numerical and one or more categorical variables.

    boxplot(): Used for displaying the distribution of a variable across different categories using boxes.
    violinplot(): Similar to a boxplot, but also shows the kernel probability density of the data.

    barplot(): Shows point estimates and confidence intervals as rectangular bars; useful for comparing between different categories.

    Purpose: These functions are designed to visualize data where one axis represents a categorical variable. They help in understanding the distribution and central tendencies of the data across categories.

    Example Use Case: Using a barplot to compare the average heights of different species of plants. It can highlight which species tends to be taller on average.

    * Distribution
    distplot(): Provides a way to visualize the univariate distribution of data. (Note: As of recent versions of Seaborn, distplot() is deprecated and replaced with displot(), histplot(), kdeplot(), and ecdfplot()).

    kdeplot(): Used for Kernel Density Estimation plots, which are a way to estimate the probability density function of a continuous random variable.

    jointplot(): Combines two different distributions and plots them jointly.

    Purpose: These functions are used for examining univariate and bivariate distributions. They help in understanding the underlying frequency distribution (shape) of a set of continuous or discrete data.

    Example Use Case: Using kdeplot to visualize the distribution of exam scores in a class, which can help to understand the overall performance and identify if the scores are normally distributed, skewed, etc.


3. Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow. What are some key sections or elements featured in the cheat sheet that can help a developer quickly reference Seaborn functionalities?

    * It serves as a quick reference guide, allowing developers to access information about Seaborn's functionalities without the need to comb through detailed documentation. This is particularly helpful in a fast-paced development environment where efficiency and speed are crucial.
