# Reading Notes Class 1

## Why this is important

* React is a very powerful tool that is widely used in software development. As we start our first week in the 301 class, it's important to know the basics of what React is, and how it behaves.

## Component Based Architecture

1. What is a component?

    * In React, a component is a reusable, self-contained piece of code that defines a part of a user interface (UI).

2. What are the characteristics of a component?

    * Reusability, encapsulation, composability, state and props, event handling, conditional rendering, hooks, seperation of concerns

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

    * Reusability, modularity, scalability, maintainability, collaberation, testing, ease of debugging

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

1. What is “props” short for?

    * properties

2. How are props used in React?

    * Used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props allow you to make your components dynamic and reusable by providing a way to configure or customize their behavior.

3. What is the flow of props?

    * The flow of props in React follows a unidirectional data flow, meaning that data is passed down from a parent component to its child components. This flow ensures a clear and predictable way of managing data within a React application.
