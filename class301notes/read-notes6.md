# Reading Notes Class 6

## What Google learned from its quest to build the perfect team

1. To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?

    * My previous work experience was the Army. There is little to no psychological safety. It definitely influenced my decision to get out after 1 contract.

2. How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?

    * This article reinforces the idea that the best approach to team building is to just be nice to eachother. Moving forward I will do my best to maintain a psychologically safe work environment

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

    * He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

    * Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    * HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

4. What does a GET do?

    * "Gets" information from somewhere like a database.

5. What does a POST do?

    * Creates or adds information to later be able to get it. "Creates a noun"

6. What does PUT do?

    * Replaces or updates information

7. What does PATCH do?

    * Updates part of some data
