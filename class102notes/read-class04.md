## What is a semantic element?

In HTML, a semantic element is an element that carries meaning or represents the structure and content of a web page in a way that is meaningful to both the browser and the developer. Semantic elements are used to convey the purpose of different parts of a web page, making it clear what role each section or element plays in the overall structure. They help improve the accessibility, search engine optimization, and maintainability of web pages.
