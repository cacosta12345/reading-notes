# Reading Notes Class 8

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

* An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

* Loops allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code. There are several benefits to using loops such as: Automation, efficiency, scalability, simplification

## When does a for loop stop executing?

* The loop continues to execute as long as the specified condition remains true?

## How many times will a while loop execute?

* The loop continues running as long as the condition reamins true. The number of times a while loop will execute depends on how the condition is set and when it becomes false.
