# Reading Notes Class 7

## What is control flow?

* The control is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

## What is a JavaScript function?

* A function is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function.

## What does it mean to invoke -or- call a function?

When a function is called, arguments are passed to the function as input, and the function can optionally return a value. A function in JavaScript is also an object.

## What are the parenthesis for when you define a function?

* Inside the parentheses, you list the parameters or arguments that the function accepts. Parameters are essentially placeholders for values that you can use within the function. When the function is called, these parameters are replaced with actual values provided by the caller.
